Constructors are invoked implicitly whereas methods are invoked explicitly. Constructor does not return any value where the method may/may not return a value. In case constructor is not present, a default constructor is provided by java compiler. In the case of a method, no default method is provided. Constructor should be of the same name as that of class. Method name should not be of the same name as that of class.
[Java] 22.What are the differences between Arrays and ArrayList in Java? (2 min.) - Solution: An array is basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection framework in Java.

[Java] 37. What is the concept of Encapsulation? (2 min.) - Solution: This is one of the concepts of OOP and it allows us to hide the name of the variable. We set the variables we want hidden to have a private AccessMod and then create getter() and setter() methods to set and retrieve the values of those private variables....but it doesnt mean we reveal what the variables actually stand for.
[Java] 38. What is the concept of Inheritance? (2 min.) - Solution: Inheritance is one of the concepts of OOP and it is a "relationship" between classes. When a class inherits another class it is saying it has an "IS A" relationship with that class(Superclass to Subclass / Parent to Child). It is the fastest way to make a class rich. If you want to invoke the methods or variables of the SuperClass then you have to use the keyword |super.| or |super()| as opposed to |this.| or |this()|. Syntax: public class Honda extends Car{.

It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects. Like the test directory which is: src->test->java. When executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the POM in the current directory. It reads the POM, gets the needed config. info, then executes the goal.
[Selenium] 41. What is build? (2 min.) - Solution: A build is numerous automated processes that are created and ran to execute repeated commands. There are 3 build lifecycles in Maven: default, clean and site. They all facilitate in running your Java code. The DEFAULT lifecycle handles your project deployment, the CLEAN lifecycle handles project cleaning, while the SITE lifecycle handles the creation of your project's site documentation.

Selenium Remote Control: to write automated web application UI tests in any programming language 3. Selenium WebDriver: execute your tests against different browser  4. Selenium GRID: runs your tests on different machines against different browsers in parallel
[Selenium] 51. What it's the difference between Implicit Wait Vs Explicit Wait? (2 min.) - Solution: An explicit wait makes WebDriver wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further with execution. An implicit wait makes WebDriver poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to locate an element, before throwing "NoSuchElement Exception"
[Selenium] 52. What are various ways of locating an element in Selenium? (2 min.) - Solution: By using any of the Selenium locators: Id, name, className, xpath, cass, linkText, partialLinkText, tagName

[Selenium] 54. What is Absolute and Relative xpath? (2 min.) - Solution: Absolute Xpath (starts with single (/): It uses Complete path from the Root Element to the desire element. Relative Xpath (starts with single (//): You can simply start by referencing the element you want and go from there. Relative Xpath are always preferred as they are not the complete paths from the root element.

[Java] 63. What is an Exception and exception handling? (3 min.) - Solution: Exceptions are events due to which java program ends abruptly without giving expected output. Java provides a framework where a user can handle exceptions. The process of handling Exceptions is called Exception Handling. Exceptions need to be handled because they break the normal flow of execution of a program. One of the important intentions of exception handling is to prevent this break and continue program execution. Sometimes, you might want to perform some series of actions on occurring of a certain exception.
[Java] 64. Mention the class hierarchy of exception and error. (3 min.) - Solution: #1) Checked Exception: Checked exception is handled during compile time and it gives the compilation error if it is not caught and handled during compile time. #2) Unchecked Exception: In case of the unchecked exception, a compiler does not mandate to handle. The compiler ignores during compile time. #3) Error: When a scenario is fatal and the program cannot recover then JVM throws an error. Errors cannot be handled by the try-catch block. Even if the user tries to handle the error by using Try catch block, it cannot recover from the error.
[Java] 65. How do you handle an exception? (3 min.) - Solution:  Try and Catch block: try-catch blocks are generally used to handle exceptions. Type of exceptions is declared in catch block which is expected to come. When an exception comes in try block, immediately control moves to catch block.  throws Exception: throws keyword in java is used to throw an exception rather than handling it. All checked exceptions can be thrown by methods.  finally block: finally, block executes irrespective of execution of try-catch block and it executes immediately after try/catch block completes. Throwable: Throwable is a parent class for error and exception. Generally, it is difficult to handle errors in java. If a programmer is not sure about the type of error and exception, then it is advised to use the Throwable class which can catch both error and exception.

[Java] 88. Can we override the static methods? (2 min.) - Solution: No, we can not override static methods. If a static method is created with a similar method signature as a method being passed down by inheritance this will be method hiding, not  overriding.
[Java] 89. Can we execute a program without main() method? (2 min.) - Solution: Yes, one of the ways to execute the program without the main method is using static block. Also, in testing we use other approaches such as the Test annotations to run the code.
[Java] 90. What is difference between stack and heap? (2 min.) - Solution: Both are used for memory but have different purposes. Stack: Stores primitives, method calls, and references; Heap: Stores the objects themselves. The String pool is also in the heap.
[Java] 91. What are Wrapper classes? (2 min.) - Solution: Wrapper classes are object representations of primitive datatypes. These classes are needed to be able to store primitive like data in collections such as ArrayList. These wrapper classes also have useful utility methods.
